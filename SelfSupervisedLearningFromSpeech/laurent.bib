Max pooling over random instead of spatial pyramid regions also improves performance (far less than using the true SPM regions), this is not true when average pooling is used. Average pooling over random patches is merely a (poorer) estimate from the BoW histogram than the complete image BoW histogram. The max over a smaller region is not an estimator of the max over the complete image. Macro features concatenate a set of low-level descriptors, eg 2x2 sifts to yield a 2x2x128=512 d descriptor Some theoretical analysis of why max-pooling could be leading to more discriminative description, not too convincing.},

Multiple feature vectors per image

Genrative models over features per class = tag.
o First fit a MoG to features of each image
o Then merge the MoG's in a more compact MoG 

For keyword based retrieval the procedure is :
o annotate test images with 5 words that have highest p(word | features)
o rank images that are annotated with word according to p(word | features)

=> It is noted that results are better when ranking is restricted to images for which word is top label.},

	Review = {Uses a variety of SIFT descriptors and extensions that are pooled over regions by means of (elementwise) max of avrg over the outerproducts of the features. Once features are computed, they learn an SVM regression model to predict the overlap with ground truth segments, using not only the VOC'11 segmentations, but additional complete segmentations on all training images from Berkeley [32]. The last step consists in compositing the segments from different classes into a single segmentation image. This is done by overlaying progressively lower scoring segments, where the top scoring segments occlude lower scoring ones. A threshold is set to retain on average the right amount of objects per image, which is used to clip the initial list of segments. Once the first segment is selected, later ones are included only if they surpass a progressively more stringent threshold that increases by a constant (0.02) after each segment is added. The expected output for VOC segmentation (2012 version) is an index image with values 0--20 for bg and the 20 classes. Performance for VOC segmentation is measured as follows per class using an intersection over union measure correct pixels for the class / (pixels labeled either in the GT or the prediction as that class).},

	Abstract = { The aim of this paper is fine-grained categorization without human interaction. Different from prior work, which relies on detectors for specific object parts, we propose to localize distinctive details by roughly aligning the objects using just the overall shape, since implicit to fine-grained categorization is the existence of a super-class shape shared among all classes. The alignments are then used to transfer part annotations from training images to test images (supervised alignment), or to blindly yet consistently segment the object in a number of regions (unsupervised alignment). We furthermore argue that in the distinction of fine-grained sub-categories, classification-oriented encodings like Fisher vectors are better suited for describing localized information than popular matching oriented features like HOG. We evaluate the method on the CU-2011 Birds and Stanford Dogs fine-grained datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art. },

They argue that the mean of the negative class m_0 can be estimated class independent, since it is roughly the overall sample mean, if the possitive class is small. However, we are interested in the difference of the class center vectors. It turns out that (m_+ - m_- ) = (m_0 - m_+) *N / (N-M) where N is the overall number of samples and M is the nr of positive samples. Thus we show that we can get the difference vector exactly from the overall sample mean and count, together witht the positive sample mean and count.},

Also refers to using the square root "to alleviate the effect of heavy tails" Proposes to consider the likelihood ratio of data x and y to (1) be generated by the same parameter p(x|m_xy)p(y|m_xy) and (2) to be generated by separate prameters p(x|m_x)p(y|m_y). The three parameters are inferred by maximum likelihood. The distance is then taken as sqrt(-log( LHR )) They estimate the hyper parameters by treating a set of observations as iid samples from the compound model: they do not share tha latent laplace scale across any observations. Experiments on sift matching of photo-tourism data set shows significantly better matching performance, L1 is worse, and L2 is again worse than both.},

	Abstract = {Multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) refers to the
learning problems where each example is represented by a
bag/collection of instances and is labeled by multiple labels.
An example application of MIML is visual object recognition
in which each image is represented by multiple key
points (i.e., instances) and is assigned to multiple object
categories. In this paper, we study the problem of learning
a distance metric from multi-instance multi-label data.
It is significantly more challenging than the conventional
setup of distance metric learning because it is difficult to
associate instances in a bag with its assigned class labels.
We propose an iterative algorithm for MIML distance metric
learning: it first estimates the association between instances
in a bag and its assigned class labels, and learns a
distance metric from the estimated association by a discriminative
analysis; the learned metric will be used to update
the association between instances and class labels, which is
further used to improve the learning of distance metric. We
evaluate the proposed algorithm by the task of automated
image annotation, a well known MIML problem. Our empirical
study shows an encouraging result when combining
the proposed algorithm with citation-kNN, a state-of-theart
algorithm for multi-instance learning.},

Therefore, non-iid models seem useful in this context, even more so at small local scales (smaller than complete image / patch). We can derive a locally orderless representation at different spatial granularities, and model different spatial neighborhoods as iid, meaning that we assume samples in a local bag to be non-iid, but the various local-bags to be iid from each other. The FV gradient representation would be the sum of local Polya gradients, computed over the local regions Alternatively we can build a hierarchical model. At level 1 we map local features to BoW histograms computed over a limited spatial support The level1 histograms can be quantized by a mixture of Dirichlet model, into another histogram representation. We can continue doing this, each level has a growing spatial support, and quantizes the histograms from the previous level. In this case we could use a FV gradient representation over each level, where parameters are shared across the local regions in a level. Another possibility to construct a hierarchical represenatation is to quantize the FV representation of one level into a next histogram representation.},

Experiments: * Claims that Leave-One-Out error is a bad idea due to similarity between clips (same background in clips of same class) * Evaluate classification and localization error * For localization measures average-IoU over frames, and evaluates when this is above threshold (varied from 0.1 to 0.5).},

Uses constraint generation to add most violated constraint in each step for negative images. For positives, taking the max scoring at each step ensures that the max after parmeter change also satisfies constraint (maybe another max, but then also satisfies) For negatives, taking max does not suffice, as it should be below threshold, and pushing the current max under threshold might leave another above threshold. Uses ESS to search efficiently over subwindows. Compared to SVM over BoW of complete image, and manual bounding boxes. Outperforms both, as subwindow is more discriminative, and ground truth bounding box might exclude discriminative context.},

There is no discounting effect here, and we could try it out by putting a prior on the Gaussian mean and variance, and computing gradients wrt hyperparameters. This would double the patch descriptor to size (4 x 4) (spatial) x 3 (RGB) x 2 (mean + var) x 2 (hyper params per param) = 192 dim What would happen if we would do the same thing on the gradient magnitudes in both x and y direction (eg no orientation binning) ?

Score of a path is sum of window scores, find maximum via dynamic programming. Requires scores to be both positive and negative in order to potentially obtain paths that do not cover the full temporal extent. Can be extended to multiple scales by extending the trellis over scale, resulting in 27 neighbors, 9 on the same scale, and another 9 for the scale above and below.

@article{hopfield1982,
	Abstract = {{Computational properties of use of biological
                 organisms or to the construction of computers can
                 emerge as collective properties of systems having a
                 large number of simple equivalent components (or
                 neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable
                 memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow
                 of the state of a system. A model of such a system is
                 given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily
                 adapted to integrated circuits. The collective
                 properties of this model produce a content-addressable
                 memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any
                 subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time
                 evolution of the state of the system is based on
                 asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent
                 collective properties include some capacity for
                 generalization, familiarity recognition,
                 categorization, error correction, and time sequence
                 retention. The collective properties are only weakly
                 sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of
                 individual devices.}},

	Abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

	Abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},
