# AMMI Course - laurent besacier - week 2

# 1. Lecture on self supervised representation learning from speech (3h)

By Laurent Besacier, Univ. Grenoble Alpes

I will teach this course **on Wed 24th at 11am (GMT+2)** during the 2020 African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (https://aimsammi.org). 

Such approaches are very important to reduce dependence on labeled data for building speech systems. This is particularly relevant for languages with poorly standardized orthography or even for unwritten languages.

# 2. Beyond sentences: lecture / reading group on on-line speech transcription and translation and on dialog level speech transcription and translation (3h)

By Laurent Besacier, Univ. Grenoble Alpes

I will teach this course **on Fri 26th at 11am (GMT+2)** during the 2020 African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (https://aimsammi.org). 

Slides available soon.

# 3. Collecting data with mobile apps: project (10h)

By Laurent Besacier, Univ. Grenoble Alpes. You can do this project as a **pair** of students.

**Todo before starting the project (3-4h)**

The steps below must be done on your own **Mon 22d between 2pm and 5pm (GMT+2)**

(1) install lig-aikuma on your tablet or smartphone: https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/download/

(2) watch the video tutorial online on: https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/tutorial/
 
(3) read the documentation available on: https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/LIG-Aikuma_tutorial.pdf

(4) do the 90mn tutorial on : https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/lig-aikuma-in-90mn/ 

(5) read the lig-aikuma publication on : https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02264418/document 

**Project itself (6h)**

I will be online on **Tue 23d, Wed 24th, Thur 25th at 2pm (GMT+2)** for Q&A on this project. 

You can do one of the following two data collection projects:

**project 1 (tourism domain)**

You should download the file https://github.com/besacier/AMMIcourse/blob/master/BTEC-en-fr.ammi.zip
It contains utterances of BTEC corpus, which is a small English-French parallel corpus. BTEC (Basic Travel Expression Corpus) contains short sentences (10 words/sentence on average) related to the tourism domain with a small vocabulary (9218 unique tokens on the French side, 7186 on the English side).

You should record sentences **in your native language** using Lig-AIkuma from the BTEC corpus. For this, use the **ellicitation (from text) mode** and record utterances **of the dev corpus** (506 utt) by translating them on-the-fly to your native language. Before that, you should **carefully fill the speaker metadata information**.

**project 2 (medical domain)**

You should download the files available on https://github.com/besacier/AMMIcourse/tree/master/COVID-DATA 
These are translations related to COVID-19 originally created by https://translatorswithoutborders.org/covid-19 and https://better.sg/migrantworkertranslations/.
They were downloaded from this Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/alvations/covid19-translations/) shared by Liling Tang.
It contains around 250 utterances related to COVID-19 information from doctors to patients.

You should record sentences **in your native language** using Lig-AIkuma from the BTEC corpus. For this, use the **ellicitation (from text) mode** and record all Enlgish utterances **of the .tsv files** (261 utt) by translating them on-the-fly to your native language. Before that, you should **carefully fill the speaker metadata information**.
