# AMMI Course - laurent besacier - week 2

# 1. Lecture on self supervised representation learning from speech

By Laurent Besacier, Univ. Grenoble Alpes

I will teach this course during the 2020 African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (https://aimsammi.org). 

Such approaches are very important to reduce dependence on labeled data for building speech systems. This is particularly relevant for languages with poorly standardized orthography or even for unwritten languages.
